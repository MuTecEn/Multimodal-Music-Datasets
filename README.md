# Multimodal Music Datasets? Challenges and Future Goals in Music Processing

This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for the paper titled "Defining Multimodal Music Datasets and Addressing Challenges in Their Construction and Evaluation."

## Abstract
The term "multimodal music dataset" is frequently utilized to depict music-related data representing music as a multimedia art form and a multimodal experience. However, the interpretation of "multimodality" can vary across related disciplines such as musicology, music psychology, and music technology. This paper proposes a comprehensive definition of multimodality that is applicable across different music disciplines. It addresses various challenges associated with constructing, evaluating, and utilizing multimodal music datasets. Additionally, the paper categorizes these datasets based on tasks and explores theoretical methodologies aimed at improving their future construction. It also sheds light on diverse data preprocessing methods and their contributions to transparent music analysis. Furthermore, evaluation metrics, methods, and benchmarks tailored for multimodal music processing tasks are scrutinized, empowering researchers to make informed decisions and facilitating cross-study comparisons.
